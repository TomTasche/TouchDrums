TouchDrums
====
You like loud sounds? We like them too! That's why we created TouchDrums: a fucking loud drum that fits into your pocket!

44.371 users already took the opportunity and gave TouchDrums a try. Out of those, incredible **93** users have been convinced by the functionality of TouchDrums. That's a active install rate of 0,2%! Most ad-financed apps can only dream of such rates!

TouchDrums is used by hobbyists and experts alike. A few of our users outed themselves as real drummer in the comments. 

Praises

But who are we to tell you how awesome our app is? Let's just ask our customers what they think:
- "A great game lol laugh out loud"

- "Nice!"
- "Fun little drum app"
- "This was pretty cute! The melody feature is nice. The places where you can touch are too small for my clunky fat thumbs. Thanks!"
- "Can't complane to much it's free, a littel lag on the Droid"

Of course, we can't satisfy every customer and haters - being haters - gonna hate, no matter how much effort we put into our products. We want to give you an unbiased view, so let's take a look at some of the very few critics too:

Word, word.

Overall
----
All in all, this results in a fantastic average rating of 2.02 stars on the Google Play Store. That's almost as great as an average rating of top-notch apps like [Facebook Home](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.home) and [Poop Break](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.yellowcrow.poopbreak)!
