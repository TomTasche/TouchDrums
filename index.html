<p>You like loud sounds? We like them too! That's why we created TouchDrums: a fucking loud drum that fits into your pocket!</p>

<p>44.371 users already took the opportunity and gave TouchDrums a try. Out of those, incredible <strong>93</strong> users have been convinced by the functionality of TouchDrums. That's an active install rate of 0,2%! Most ad-financed apps can only dream of such rates!</p>

<p>TouchDrums is used by hobbyists and experts alike. A few of our users outed themselves as real drummer in the comments. </p>
